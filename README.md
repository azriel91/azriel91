Heya 👋, my name is Azriel, and I aim to bring joy to others through software.

I am creating [🕊️ **Peace**](https://github.com/azriel91/peace/), an automation framework written in Rust that guides developers to build resilient, user-friendly automation.

The reason for this project is I see too much frustration, stress, and burnout affecting so many people, and a realistic way to help people dealing with software-scale-problems is to provide a software-scale-solution.
